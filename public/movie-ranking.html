<h2>My top 3 movies at the moment</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Star Wars series</h3>
<p>Since watching the 1st series when it first came out, I have been a fan</p>

<h3>The Woman King</h3>
<p>This movie shows the strength of women no matter their background</p>

<h3>Avatar-The way of water</h3>
<p>This one was more on the emotional side where as the first one was more action based</p>
